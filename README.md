# 💮 Wife Shrine - Neon Waifu Gallery
> *A random post-tooth-extraction project that somehow turned into a neon aesthetic gallery.*

---

## 🦷 Backstory
It started as a chill day after a tooth extraction.  
Then came the thought: *“What if I make a waifu shrine but in dark neon style?”*  
Now here we are - an over-engineered boredom project with animations, ambient glow, and logic way too complex for its purpose 😭

## 🌌 Features
| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🎞️ **Hover Expand Animation** | Cards expand smoothly on hover, revealing full portraits and their unique aura. |
| 🩶 **Ambient Glow** | Each card adapts its glow and text color based on the image’s dominant tones. |
| 💤 **Idle Auto-Slide** | If you stay idle for 10 seconds, the gallery slides automatically. Move your mouse, and it stops. |
| 💬 **Dynamic Quote System** | Every waifu comes with custom `data-quote`, `data-anime`, and `data-name` for modal display. |
| 🪞 **Modal / Lightbox Detail** | Click a card to open the detailed modal: name, origin, and quote. |
| ☀️ **Responsive Layout** | Works perfectly on desktop and mobile with smooth scroll-snap behavior. |
| 🧠 **Hover Logic Fix** | Auto-slide no longer overlaps manual hover - finally stable. |

## 💻 Tech Stack

## 🌺 Design & Aesthetics
- Theme: **Neon dark with soft pink accent**
- Font: *Poppins / UI Sans*
- Vibe: futuristic late-night lounge meets anime shrine
- Animations fully CSS-driven - no JS animation libs.

---

## 🧩 Dev Notes
- Hover vs auto-slide conflict fully resolved.
- Global CTA handler for “Click for details” added.
- Particle effect removed (too distracting).
- Modular CSS & JS for easy customization and new effects.
